                    <h4>THE ARTIST</h4>
                    <h2>Jean Giraud, psychedelic fantasy and surrealism.</h2>
                    <p>Jean Giraud, better known by his pen name Moebius, remains one of the most influential
                        cartoonists of all time whose signature blend of psychedelic fantasy and surrealism formed the
                        aesthetic blueprint of modern
                        sci-fi.
                        <br /><br />
                        Working in the Franco-Belgian style of bandes dessinées, popularised by The Adventures of
                        Tintin and Asterix, Giraud’s
                        seminal contributions ushered in a new age for comics and the visual arts generally.
                        <br /><br />
                        After he died in 2012, Jean Giraud was mourned by the likes of Ridley Scott, Hayao Miyazaki,
                        George
                        Lucas and Stan Lee,
                        whose respective careers had all been touched by the French artist’s work. Giraud’s signature
                        style
                        has become so widely
                        imitated that signs of its influence are virtually impossible to distinguish from the norm.

                        <br /><br /><strong>As Ridley Scott noted in 2010, “You see his influence everywhere, it runs
                            through
                            so
                            much
                            you can’t
                            get away from it.”

                            <h5>THE WORLD OF EDENA</h5>
                            <p>In the initial story, Mœbius introduces protagonists Stel and Atan, who crash on a barren
                                planet
                                and
                                stumble upon
                                interstellar refugees camped around a mysterious pyramid. This leads to their transport
                                to
                                an
                                unknown world described as
                                a 'Garden of Eden' in another galaxy.<br /><br />

                                This inspired Moebius to plot out three or four books' worth of stories forming the
                                basis of
                                a
                                coherent Moebius
                                universe.<br /><br />

                                It also featured the recurrent character "Master Burg", Stel's dream guide, who
                                was meant to be the same person as "Major Grubert" from The Airtight Garage.</p>

                            <p>A collection of four wordless short stories which were originally published in
                                the French sci-fi/fantasy comics
                                magazine Métal Hurlant.
                                <br /><br />
                                The stories follow Arzach, a silent warrior who rides a pterodactyl-like creature
                                through a strange, desolate landscape.
                                The imagery and situations in Arzach are often compared to dreams or the subconscious.
                                <br /><br />
                                Arzach character is still among Moebius' most famous creations. It can be defined as
                                a pantomime comic, fantasy
                                comics or an experimental comic.

                                that one day comes into

                                Bergs and the Techno-technos- are after.
                                <br /><br />
                                The Incal guides John (and his pet Deepo) first to the Center of the Planet and then to
                                distant worlds in outer space,
                                meeting different companions along the way. He eventually returns home, where all

                                metaphysical being threatening the political stability of the Empire and the universe
                                itself.
